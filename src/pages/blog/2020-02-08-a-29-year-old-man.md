  Dylan is sitting across the table from me staring into the monitor connected
  to his laptop. He lets out a long exasperated sigh. This is one of his
  signature moves. He sighs just before he is going to stand up, or when he’s
  looking into the fridge. He even sighs when he's looking out at the surf, as
  if even bothering to exist in his own life is just too much for him.

He'll sigh as he comes out of the bathroom, after one of his thirty minute sessions in there. There were the two times I walked in on him: the first time I was cleaning the house, and noticed the closed bathroom door. I made the mistake of thinking that no noise and twenty elapsed minutes meant no one could be in there. But when I opened the door, I saw the fold of his groin, crouched over the toilet and his legs jumping back in surprise.

I used to think that extended lengths of time spend sitting over your own excrement was an unattractive character trait unique to Dylan. But I think a lot of men do this. It just seems so base. Scrolling through Instagram in there.

We don’t speak much during the day. He is making a series of cold calls to people who own property in the American River Valley. A few months ago he was laid off from the renewable energy company he worked for. His new plan involves collecting unemployment and starting an LLC—illegal, yes, but hey why not? His plan is to store energy in batteries and sell it back to PG&E at peak times. He still has access to his old company's proprietary maps showing exactly where in California the most choice plots of land are. To do this, he'll need to negotiate a land lease and apply for a subsidiary from the government. He seems to think he can accomplish this during the five months during which he’ll collect severance. 

I briefly consider what my day would look like if Dylan wasn’t at his usual post. I would have liked to play my music on the ostensibly nice speakers in the living room. They are Dylan’s. But when they blew out he sent our house a group message saying that the subwoofers and blown out and that he 'will try to fix :/' I don’t actually believe he had any intention or know-how related to fixing subwoofers. I just think he wanted to not-so-subtlely open the door for one of us to say we did it, or maybe he hoped one of us would offer to pay for it. Not sure. 

Dylan gets up to make another cup of coffee. He sighs and it’s the deepest expression of his inability to deal with the nuts and bolts tasks of his life. 

When he sits back down he is telling me that his friends are going to play at the Berkeley Greek in June. I glance over to the framed Vulfpeck poster on our living room wall. I feign interest: “Oh. And then: "Cool."

I think to myself that I should be nicer. Living with him will be easier if we have some common ground. If we pretend to be friends.

“When do tickets go on sale?” There, I carried on the conversation.

“Uhhh, I think they already did.” Short pause. “But uhh, I’m definitely not buying tickets. Benefits of knowing the band.”

He actually says this last part and he does it in one of his voices that’s supposed to be mocking a cocky self-involved person. But the sarcasm just doesn’t work because he actually comes off like a cocky self-involved person. There's a cluelessness there. Starting a conversation to peacock around your plans. I am merely entertaining his charade, trying not to be rude, and when I do, he spits it back in my face. Of course, I wasn't actually supposed to do anything with this information, I was just supposed to digest it, and think more highly of him because of it. 

I love the phrase 'god’s gift to earth' for entitled white men because it fits so perfectly. They have these deep inner wells of believing they are truly great. At one point, he was explaining to someone on the phone why he wasn’t going to sign up for a photography class. He said this one thing that I found delightful: “Yeah, it’s just gonna be too much. I mean, I surf, I climb, I write, what more do you want?”
